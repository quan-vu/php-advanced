# OOP inPHP

Introduction

- Class/Blueprint
- Instance

## Abstract Class

Abstract class can have method without body.

- Redeclare all abstract methods.
- The arguments must be the same.
- Method in child class can have additional arguments with default value.
- Method 's signature must be the same.
- Visibility of methods must be same or less retricted.
- Object can not be created from the abstract class (important).

## Interface

An Interface is provided so you can describe a set of functions and then hide the final implementation of those function in implementing class.

This allows you to change the IMPLEMENTATION of those functions without changing how you use it.
